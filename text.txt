Answer: {'query': 'What is Game Theory?', 'result': 'Game Theory is a branch of mathematics that studies strategic decision making. It provides a framework for analyzing situations in which the outcome depends on the actions of multiple individuals or parties, and in which each individual or party has a set of possible actions to choose from. Game Theory aims to predict the outcome of these interactions and to identify the optimal strategy for each player.\n\nIn essence, Game Theory is a study of how people make decisions when the outcome depends on the actions of multiple individuals or parties. It is used in a wide range of fields, including economics, politics, sociology, and computer science.\n\nIn the context of load balancing, Game Theory is used to optimize the distribution of workload across multiple servers or resources. By modeling the load balancing problem as a game, Game Theory can help identify the optimal strategy for allocating resources and minimizing delays or costs.\n\nWould you like to know more about its application in load balancing?'}
